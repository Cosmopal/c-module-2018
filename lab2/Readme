This is the submission for lab 2 of c-refresher module - Ultra simple shell.


I found a lot of help from internet - stackoverflow etc.


in the while (true) loop, the following happens:

	The current directory is printed, followed by ">>", pretty much like the usual linux terminal
	Input line is read
	Arguments are parsed from the line
	It is checked if the command is an inbuilt function ("cd" or "exit")
	If Inbuilt, then the inbuilt fn is executed
	Else the process is forked:
		execpv is used for the sys call, as it does the job of
		searching the required executable in the path variable;
		the child calls exec to be replaced by the command entered;
		if there is error, the child exits with failure message;

	If there is error loading the process, "Error Forking" is printed

	If the fork was successful, the parent waits till the child
	terminates.
